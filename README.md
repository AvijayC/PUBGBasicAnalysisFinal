# IMPORTANT INFO:

## When running the code for the first time, the code will install the required packages, then restart the R session **if you don't have the keras package already installed** (I can't control this). Please RE-RUN THE CODE a second time after running it the first time (if you don't already have keras installed on your computer).
------------------------------------------------
## IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN CODE (takes a long time, ~ 1hr+), video here: https://youtu.be/4cmProJXZG0
## If you want to watch the code run instead of running it yourself, there's a link to a youtube video above.
### This shows the code running on a fresh install of R, on a c5.2xlarge AWS EC2 instance.
