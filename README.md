# IMPORTANT INFO:

## When running the code for the first time, the code will install the required packages, then restart the R session **if you don't have the keras package already installed** (I can't control this). 
## Please RE-RUN THE CODE a second time after running it the first time (if you don't already have keras installed on your computer).
### It is recommended to have a lot of free space to accomodate the installs. 
------------------------------------------------
## This code will automatically install a lot of packages and external tools. (tensorflow, keras, miniconda, python 3.6, and more). 
### These installs (python, miniconda) are required for tensorflow and keras to run (they're mostly based in python). If you don't want to wait for this to run OR don't want to install keras / tensorflow on your machine, you can watch a video of the code running instead.
## If you want to watch the code run instead of running it yourself, there's a link to a youtube video here. 
### This shows the code running on a fresh install of R, on a c5.2xlarge AWS EC2 instance.
