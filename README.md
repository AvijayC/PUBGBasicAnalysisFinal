# IMPORTANT INFO:

## When running the code for the first time, the code will install the required packages, then restart the R session. (I can't control this). 
## Please RE-RUN THE CODE a second time after running it the first time. 

## This code will automatically install a lot of packages and external tools. (tensorflow, keras, miniconda, python 3.6, and more). 
### These installs (python, miniconda) are required for tensorflow and keras to run (they're mostly based in python)
### It is recommended to have a lot of free space to accomodate the installs. 
## If you want to watch the code run instead of running it yourself, there's a link to a youtube video here. 
### This shows the code running on a fresh install of R, on a c5.2xlarge AWS EC2 instance.
