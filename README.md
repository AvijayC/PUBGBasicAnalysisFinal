# IMPORTANT INFO:
## This code will install a lot of packages and external tools. (tensorflow, keras, miniconda, python 3.6, and more). 
## It is recommended to have a lot of free space to accomodate the installs. 
## If you want to watch the code run instead of running it yourself, there's a link to a youtube video here.
